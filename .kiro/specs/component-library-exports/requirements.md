# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a centralized export system for the component library by automatically exporting all components from the `src/components` directory through the main `index.ts` file. This will provide a clean, single entry point for importing components from the library, making it easier for consumers to access all available components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using this component library, I want to import any component from a single entry point, so that I can easily access all available components without needing to know their specific file paths.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the index.ts file is updated THEN it SHALL export all components from the src/components directory
2. WHEN a new component is added to src/components THEN it SHALL be automatically exportable through the main index
3. WHEN importing from the library THEN developers SHALL be able to use `import { ComponentName } from 'library'` syntax

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a library maintainer, I want the export system to handle both individual components and UI components, so that the entire component ecosystem is accessible through one interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing the components directory THEN the system SHALL export components from src/components/ui subdirectory
2. WHEN processing the components directory THEN the system SHALL export components from the root src/components directory
3. WHEN exporting components THEN the system SHALL preserve the original component names and exports

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the export system to be maintainable and follow TypeScript best practices, so that the library remains type-safe and easy to work with.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting components THEN the system SHALL maintain TypeScript type information
2. WHEN creating exports THEN the system SHALL use proper ES6 export syntax
3. WHEN organizing exports THEN the system SHALL group related exports logically

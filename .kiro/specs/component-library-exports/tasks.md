# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Analyze existing component structure and prepare export list
  - Scan src/components/ui directory to identify all component files
  - Identify the named exports from each UI component file
  - Create a comprehensive list of all components to be exported
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 2.2_

- [x] 2. Update index.ts with UI component exports
  - Add export statements for all UI components in alphabetical order
  - Use `export * from` syntax to maintain all named exports from each component
  - Group related component exports together (e.g., card components, form components)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 3.2_

- [x] 3. Add core component exports to index.ts
  - Export ThemeProvider and any other root-level components from src/components
  - Ensure no naming conflicts between UI and core components
  - Maintain proper organization with clear section comments
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.2, 3.2_

- [ ] 4. Verify and test the export system
  - Create a test file to verify all components can be imported from the main index
  - Test importing individual components and multiple components in single import
  - Verify TypeScript compilation succeeds with all new exports
  - Check that existing functionality (CSS imports, utilities) still works
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 5. Validate export completeness and organization
  - Ensure all component files from both ui and core directories are exported
  - Verify alphabetical ordering and logical grouping of exports
  - Confirm no duplicate exports or naming conflicts exist
  - Test tree-shaking compatibility is maintained
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.2_

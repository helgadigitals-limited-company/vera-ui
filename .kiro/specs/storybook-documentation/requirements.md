# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add comprehensive Storybook documentation for all UI components in the component library, along with overall project documentation. The goal is to create an interactive component showcase that helps developers understand, test, and implement components effectively. This will include stories for all existing UI components, proper documentation, and project-level documentation that explains the library's purpose, setup, and usage patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using this component library, I want to see interactive examples of all UI components, so that I can understand how each component works and what props are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the Storybook interface THEN I SHALL see all UI components organized in a logical structure
2. WHEN I select a component story THEN I SHALL see the component rendered with example props
3. WHEN I interact with component controls THEN I SHALL be able to modify props in real-time to see changes
4. IF a component has multiple variants THEN each variant SHALL have its own story or be controllable via controls

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation for each component, so that I can understand the component's purpose, API, and usage patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a component story THEN I SHALL see documentation describing the component's purpose
2. WHEN I view component documentation THEN I SHALL see all available props with types and descriptions
3. WHEN I view component examples THEN I SHALL see code snippets showing how to use the component
4. IF a component has accessibility features THEN those features SHALL be documented

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see different states and variations of components, so that I can understand all possible use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view a component's stories THEN I SHALL see examples of different states (default, hover, disabled, error, etc.)
2. WHEN a component supports different sizes or variants THEN I SHALL see examples of each
3. WHEN a component has complex interactions THEN I SHALL see stories demonstrating those interactions
4. IF a component works with forms THEN I SHALL see form integration examples

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want comprehensive project documentation, so that I can quickly understand the project structure, setup process, and contribution guidelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the project documentation THEN I SHALL see an overview of the component library's purpose
2. WHEN I want to set up the project THEN I SHALL find clear installation and setup instructions
3. WHEN I want to contribute THEN I SHALL find guidelines for adding new components and stories
4. WHEN I need to understand the project structure THEN I SHALL find documentation explaining the codebase organization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a designer or product manager, I want to browse components visually, so that I can understand what's available and make design decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I browse the component library THEN I SHALL see visual examples without needing technical knowledge
2. WHEN I want to understand component capabilities THEN I SHALL see clear visual demonstrations
3. WHEN I need to reference components for design work THEN I SHALL be able to easily find and share component examples
4. IF components have design tokens or theming THEN those SHALL be visually demonstrated

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Storybook setup to integrate well with the existing project structure, so that it doesn't interfere with the current development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run the development server THEN Storybook SHALL not conflict with the existing Vite setup
2. WHEN I build the project THEN Storybook build SHALL be separate from the main project build
3. WHEN I add new components THEN adding Storybook stories SHALL follow a consistent pattern
4. IF the project uses TypeScript THEN Storybook SHALL have proper TypeScript support and type checking
